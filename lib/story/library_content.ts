The founders discovered that light could ward off the malevolent spirits that roamed at night. They built their homes close together, ensuring no shadow went unwatched. The tradition of lighting torches at dusk continues to this day.

The town has grown from a small outpost to a thriving community, with a library, workshop, and general store serving the needs of its residents. Despite the dangers that lurk beyond its walls, Torch Town remains a beacon of civilization in an otherwise dark world.`,

It spoke of riddles, testing whether I could see light in darkness, hear what speaks without sound, and grasp what moves yet cannot be held.

I fled before answering, but the echo of its words haunts me. It guards something powerful, I'm certain—perhaps a means to traverse great distances. Time seems to stand still in that place. If you seek this treasure, bring patience. Silence is the first lesson, it said, and the echo of your thoughts the final test.`,
