## 🕸 Relationship Web

Here’s where we add fuel for dynamic dialog:

* Eldra distrusts Maro → possible quest to reconcile them.
* Bren vs. Yanna → ongoing tension about laziness vs. value of herbs.
* Mira spreads gossip → can unlock secret opinions if befriended.
* Kira + Lio romance subplot → blocked by Rhett who thinks Lio is unreliable.
* Dara outsider → town divided: Serin wants to help, Fenna mistrusts.
* Sela + Maro drinking → secret connection; if revealed, affects town trust.
* Arin’s unspoken love → gossip risk, could lead to fight with Rhett.
* Fenna vs. Yanna → potential sabotage event involving the flame.

---

## 🔑 Possible Gameplay Hooks

* Helping resolve tensions could unlock **items** (herbal salves, special weapons).
* Befriending or angering an NPC changes **dialog priorities**.
* Certain quests only available at **day vs. night** (guards swap, store closes).
* The **central flame** can dim or flare based on outcomes of town storylines.
