## Dungeon Tiler Plan File

Refer to the coding methodology in `__plans__/coding_methodology.md` before taking any action in here.

## Notes

- User requested to refactor the codebase so that each component is in its own file before further iteration.
- Identified components: Home (main page), Tile (tile cell in grid), Legend (legend display)
- Created components directory and separated Tile, Legend, and TilemapGrid into their own files
- Transitioning to TDD: Will set up a test framework and write tests for components
- Jest and React Testing Library configured for testing React components
- TDD cycle complete for Tile; now targeting Legend component (tests written and run)
- TDD cycle complete for Legend; now targeting TilemapGrid (failing tests written, partial implementation in progress)
- TDD cycle complete for TilemapGrid (all tests passing, ready for next phase)
- DT-2 requirements for random grid generation are now active; next step is to follow the TDD cycle for these rules
- Failing tests for DT-2 (random grid generation) have been written; now implementing the generation logic to pass these tests
- DT-2 generation logic implemented; next step is to refactor if needed after tests pass
- All DT-2 tests are now passing; refactor step complete, ready for next phase
- DT-3 and DT-4 requirements for floor connectivity and room count are now active; next step is to follow the TDD cycle for these rules
- The current dungeon generation algorithm is modular and can be replaced with another. Future tickets can direct or swap out the algorithm without breaking the rest of the app.

- [x] start using the new algorithm in the TilemapGrid component once it is ready
- [x] Refactor the center-out algorithm to generate a single room in the center of the grid between 9 and 100 tiles in size. The rest should be walls.
- [x] Refactor the center-out algorithm to generate a random number of rooms between 1 and 4 in the center of the grid between 9 and 100 tiles in size. The rest should be walls.
- [x] Refactor the center-out algorithm to generate a random number of rooms between 3 and 6 in the center of the grid between 9 and 100 tiles in size. The rest should be walls.
- [x] The Grid should at least 50% floor tiles and at most 75% floor tiles
- [x] Walls and floors can have subtypes, stored as enum values in an array of numbers.
- [x] Subtypes are displayed next to the tile number in each grid cell.
- [x] Make the wall tile text visible, light text over the dark tile please
- [x] There should always be a single wall tile in the grid with the type 2 which will be "door" AND the type 1 which will be "exit". The exit tile should be placed next to a floor tile.
- [x] There may be a wall or tile with the type 3 which will be 'key'. A key will correspond to a lock which will be type 4. Type 3 and 4 always need to be used together and need to reference each other so that the key can unlock the lock.
- [x] A User is represented by a tile with the type 5 which will be "player". The player tile should be placed on a floor tile.
- [x] When the user clicks the right arrow key the player should move one tile to the right if the tile is a floor tile.
- [x] When the user clicks the left arrow key the player should move one tile to the left if the tile is a floor tile.
- [x] When the user clicks the up arrow key the player should move one tile up if the tile is a floor tile.
- [x] When the user clicks the down arrow key the player should move one tile down if the tile is a floor tile.
- [x] When the player moves to a tile with a subtype the subtype should be removed from the tile.
- [x] When the player moves to a tile with a subtype the subtype should be added to an inventory array.
- [x] Only part of the map is visible at any given time. The player should be able to move the visible area of the map around the player. A player can see 4 tiles in all directions. The tiles that are invisible are displayed as black, the unexplored but remembered wall tiles are displayed as dark gray, the floor tiles as lighter gray, and the player tile is displayed in blue.
- [x] Add subtype 6 for lightswitch - it toggles off the visibility of the map so they can see the whole map.
- [x] Stepping on a switch should not pick remove it from the tile.
- [x] The lightswitch should only work for 3 seconds and then flicker back off.
- [x] Add subtype 7 for exitKey - it must be used to open the exit door
- [x] A sword is only found inside a chest, so in the generation, a sword will need a chest in the same tile.
- [x] Stepping onto a chest item should add the item in the chest to the inventory and remove the chest from the tile, adding an OPEN_CHEST subtype on that tile.
- [x] Building off the visual design implemented currently, try to give some forced perspective to the walls by making the bottom border if the wall tile has a floor tile below it taller than the other borders.
- [x] Implement this // TODO - if bottom neighbor is false then its a wall and we shoudl rend er the top of the wall in the bottom off this tile - need the asset first

### Visual Polish

- [x] Render circular field-of-view (FOV) using Euclidean distance instead of Manhattan
- [x] Add fading tiers near FOV boundary (full/mid/low/invisible)

## Current Goal

### End-Game Modal (Exit Open -> Step Onto Exit)

We will implement a simple end-game modal that appears when the player opens the exit using the exit key and moves onto the exit tile.

TDD Test Breakdown:

- [x] lib: Opening exit with exit key and moving onto it sets `gameState.win = true`.
- [x] lib: Attempting to move into exit without exit key does NOT set `gameState.win`.
- [x] lib: Moving onto a normal floor tile does NOT set `gameState.win`.
- [ ] components: When `gameState.win` becomes true after a move, `TilemapGrid` renders an end-game modal with the message. (superseded by redirect)
- [ ] components: No modal is shown when `gameState.win` is false. (superseded by redirect)
- [ ] components: Modal content text is exactly the expected copy for snapshot/strict assertion. (superseded by redirect)

Next: Redirect to End Page and Persist Game Data

TDD Test Breakdown:

- [x] components: When `win` becomes true, `TilemapGrid` stores the final game payload in `sessionStorage` under a stable key (e.g., `lastGame`) and navigates to `/end` via router push.
- [x] components: The storage payload contains map, inventory flags, and optional summary fields.
- [x] app/end: End page reads `sessionStorage.lastGame` and renders a summary view. If missing, shows a fallback message.
- [x] components: No redirect occurs when `win` is false.

Implementation Notes:

- Use Next App Router `useRouter().push('/end')`.
- Persist to `sessionStorage` (ephemeral, per-tab) to avoid URL bloat.
- End page is a client component that hydrates from `sessionStorage` on mount.

Implementation Notes:

- Add `win: boolean` to `GameState` (default `false`).
- In `movePlayer()`, when the exit is opened using `hasExitKey` and the player moves onto it, set `win = true`.
- In `TilemapGrid.tsx`, render a simple modal overlay when `gameState.win` is true. Keep it minimal for now.
  - Superseded by redirect to `/end` with persisted `lastGame`.

### New Feature: Chests, Sword, Shield (and lockable containers)

Goal: Introduce a `CHEST` subtype that may be locked or unlocked. Opening a chest yields an item (`SWORD` or `SHIELD`). Eventually, locks can be placed on other items too, but start with chests.

TDD Test Breakdown:

- [ ] lib: Stepping onto an unlocked chest opens it and grants its content (e.g., sword), removing the chest from the tile.
- [x] lib: Stepping onto an unlocked chest opens it and grants its content (e.g., sword), removing the chest from the tile.
- [ ] lib: Stepping onto a locked chest without a key does NOT open it (no item granted, chest remains).
- [ ] lib: Stepping onto a locked chest WITH a key opens it, consumes one key, grants content, removes the chest.
- [ ] lib: Chest contents support at least `SWORD` and `SHIELD`.
- [ ] lib: Picking up `SWORD` sets `gameState.hasSword = true`.
- [ ] lib: Picking up `SHIELD` sets `gameState.hasShield = true`.
- [ ] lib: Moving onto normal floors does not modify `hasSword`/`hasShield`.
- [ ] lib: Map generation can place a small number of chests on valid floor tiles, some locked, some unlocked, with randomized content.
- [ ] components: Inventory UI displays sword/shield when owned.
- [ ] components: Legend shows CHEST, SWORD, SHIELD entries.

Implementation Notes:

- Extend `TileSubtype` with `CHEST`, `SWORD`, `SHIELD`.
- Add `hasSword`, `hasShield` to `GameState` and initialize to `false`.
- Represent locked chests either as `CHEST` plus `LOCK` in subtypes or via a separate metadata map; prefer `CHEST` + `LOCK` for consistency.
- On move:
  - If stepping onto `CHEST` + (optional `LOCK`):
    - If `LOCK` present and `hasKey=false`, block open (player remains on current tile).
    - If `LOCK` present and `hasKey=true`, consume key and open.
    - Opening grants item and removes `CHEST` (+`LOCK`) from tile.
- Update `generateCompleteMap()` to place chests with mixed lock states and contents.

### Standardized Tile Subtype Rendering

Goal: Implement a standardized, extensible method to render multiple subtypes on dungeon tiles without replacing the background tile pattern.

TDD Test Breakdown:

- [x] components: Multiple subtypes can be displayed on a single tile as separate icons.
- [x] components: Subtype icons are rendered on top of the base tile without replacing the background pattern.
- [x] components: Each subtype has a unique visual representation (color and symbol).
- [x] components: Subtype icons are positioned properly on both floor and wall tiles.

Implementation Notes:

- Created a reusable `renderSubtypeIcons()` function in the Tile component.
- Added CSS classes for subtype container and individual icons.
- Implemented helper functions for subtype colors and symbols.
- Updated both floor and wall tile rendering to use the standardized approach.
- Ensured all tests pass with the new implementation.
